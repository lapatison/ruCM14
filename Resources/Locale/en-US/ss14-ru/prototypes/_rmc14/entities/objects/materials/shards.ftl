ent-CMShardBase = { ent-ShardBase }
    .desc = { ent-ShardBase.desc }
ent-CMShardGlass = glass shard
    .desc = A shard of broken glass. Could probably be used as ... a throwing weapon?
ent-CMShardPhoron = phoron shard
    .desc = A shard of broken phoron glass. Considerably tougher than normal glass shards. Apparently not tough enough to be a window.
